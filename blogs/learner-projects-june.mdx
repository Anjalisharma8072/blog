Starting with the first one...

As part of The Legend of Python’s final project, Vance, aka @caesiumtea, recreated the viral New York Times game, Wordle, in the terminal. Instructions on how to play are in the **README** file. See if you can guess the correct 5-letter word in 6 tries! 🟩 🟨 ⬜️ 🟨 🟩

#### Raspberry Pi Project

![Gonzo](https://i.imgur.com/Ozn9N23.png)

**Built by:** [@b321gonzo](https://www.codedex.io/@b321gonzo) 🇺🇸
**Tools:** Raspberry Pi and Python

Using a [Raspberry Pi](website) and a motor, Brett, aka @b321gonzo, created his first hardware project! When he presses the green button, the motor starts running slowly. Even cooler, if he presses it twice, the motor will speed up from slow to medium to fast. The red button works similarly but in the opposite direction. If the green button is already pressed and he presses the red button, or vice versa, the motor will stop. Pretty cool!

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", marginBottom: "1.2rem", transform: "scale(.9)" }}>
