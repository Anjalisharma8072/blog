Welcome to our first edition of Learner Projects Showcase. Here are five of the most liked projects in the Codédex community last month! 🤗 

Starting with the first one...

#### Wordle: Terminal Edition

**Built by:** [@caesiumtea](https://www.codedex.io/@caesiumtea) 🇺🇲

As part of The Legend of Python’s final project, Vance aka @caesiumtea recreated the viral New York Times game, [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), in the terminal. Instructions on how to play are in the **README** file. See if you can guess the correct 5-letter word in 6 tries! 🟩 🟨 ⬜️ 🟨 🟩

#### Swahili Flashcards

**Built by:** @Milan 🇸🇮 

Do you want to learn another language? Here's a beautiful GUI (Graphical User Interface) application created using Python’s `tkinter` and `random` module, and `pandas` library to practice Swahili on virtual flashcards.

#### League of Legends Signup Page

**Built by:** [@Adrian7](https://www.codedex.io/@Adrian7) 🇮🇷

An account register page for LoL using HTML forms and CSS, which also includes response buttons and text boxes. To run the code yourself, head over to Codédex’s editor and input the HTML.

#### Raspberry Pi Project 

**Built by:** [@b321gonzo](https://www.codedex.io/@b321gonzo) 🇺🇸

Using [Raspberry Pi](website), Brett aka @b321gonzo implemented a feature so that if he were to press the green button, the motor would turn on at a slow speed. However, if he chooses to press it two more times, it goes from slow to medium to fast and then back to slow, and so on. The red does the same thing but in the opposite direction. If green is going and he presses red, or vice versa, the motor will stop. Pretty cool! 

Watch the video to couple with the explanation, it’s all there!
