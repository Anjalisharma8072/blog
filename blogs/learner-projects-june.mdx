Welcome to our first edition of Learner Projects Showcase. Here are five of the most liked projects in the Codédex community last month! 🤗

Starting with the first one...

#### Wordle: Terminal Edition

**Tools:** Python, `random`, `requests`, and `termcolor`

As part of The Legend of Python’s final project, Vance aka @caesiumtea recreated the viral New York Times game, Wordle, in the terminal. Instructions on how to play are in the **README** file. See if you can guess the correct 5-letter word in 6 tries! 🟩 🟨 ⬜️ 🟨 🟩

#### Raspberry Pi Project

![Gonzo](https://i.imgur.com/Ozn9N23.png)

**Built by:** [@b321gonzo](https://www.codedex.io/@b321gonzo) 🇺🇸
**Tools:** Raspberry Pi and Python

Hardware projects ftw! Using [Raspberry Pi](website), Brett aka @b321gonzo implemented a feature so that if he were to press the green button, the motor would turn on at a slow speed. However, if he chooses to press it two more times, it goes from slow to medium to fast and then back to slow, and so on. The red does the same thing but in the opposite direction. If green is going and he presses red, or vice versa, the motor will stop. Pretty cool!

Using HTML/CSS and Vue.js, Austin aka @choisauce turned his passion for hosting game show panels at various anime conventions into a web app. Choisauce has hosted Anime Jeopardy, Anime Music Quiz, The Anime Dating game, and many other panels at cons such as Level Up Expo, Tsumicon, Shinecon, and others across the country.
