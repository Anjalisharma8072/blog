For the month of May, we'd like to try something different and fun! With the advent of artificial intelligence, we'd like to invite you to generate some coding-related art! 🤖 🖌️ 🎨

Be as creative as you'd like, but make sure that what you generate is related to coding, programming, or tech.

Here are a few places you can go to generate some art for free:

- <a href="https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2">DALL-E 2 (OpenAI)</a>
- <a href="https://stablediffusionweb.com/">Stable Diffusion</a>
- <a href="https://www.midjourney.com/home/?callbackUrl=%2Fapp%2F">Midjourney</a>
- <a href="https://nightcafe.studio/">NightCafe</a>

While the time may be variable, this challenge should take no more than one hour to complete. After finishing, post a screenshot in the Twitter thread.

Please submit your image by Wednesday, May 24th so that our Discord community has ample time to vote on the winner!

**Note:** Only one image submission per user.
