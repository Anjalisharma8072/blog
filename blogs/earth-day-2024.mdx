HAPPY EARTH DAY 2024 ヾ( ˃ᴗ˂ )◞ • *✰ 

Spring is in the air! And new trees are budding! (Wait what? Keep reading 👀) 

It’s Monday, April 22nd which means that it’s the day of the year where we honor our little home planet. In celebration, we are partnering with One Tree Planted because…

**We are planting one tree for every person that signs up for a Codédex Club membership! 🌱**

And actually… (sorry, we kept it a secret!), we’ve started since January 1st this year.

#### What is “One Tree Planted”?

[One Tree Planted](https://onetreeplanted.org) (OTP) is a 501c3 non-profit with a focus on global reforestation. 

Started in 2014, OTP has worked with 378+ reforestation partners across 82+ countries. These OTP projects restore forests after fires and floods, create jobs, build communities, and protect habitat for wildlife. In 2023, OTP planted over 51 million trees. 🌳

#### But… aren't you an early-stage startup?

> “If you won’t give a dime out of a dollar, you won’t give $1 million out of $10 million.” - Tony Robbins

Money is oxygen for a new business and we are not a profitable one. So this is against YC, business school, and startup books advice to be relentlessly resourceful and frugal, but hey, we’ve broken pretty much every conventional startup rule by now.

Tony Robbins once said, “If you won’t give a dime out of a dollar, you won’t give $1 million out of $10 million. The time to give is now. When I had nothing, I began this process. The reward is that if you give, even at the times when you think you have very little, you’ll teach your brain that there is more than enough. You can leave scarcity behind and move toward a world of abundance.”

Giving back begins not when we become profitable, but now, in the early days when we get to define the type of company we want to become one day.

Earth is all we’ve got. I hope you get to touch some grass today.

Happy Earth Day ⋆˙⟡
