## Wordle: Terminal Edition
### Created by [@Vance](https://www.codedex.io/@caesiumtea) 🇺🇲


As part of The Legend of Python’s final project, Vance recreated the viral New York Times game, Wordle. Instructions on how to play are in the **README** file. See if you can guess the correct word in 6 tries!

## League of Legends Sign up Page
### Created by @LichKing 

An account register page for LoL using HTML forms and CSS, which also includes response buttons and text boxes. To run the code yourself, head over to Codédex’s editor and input the HTML. 

Source code here: https://github.com/Kingofprund/LOL-register 


## Raspberry Pi Project
### 🏮Built by @Gonzo

Using [Raspberry Pi](website), Gonzo implemented a feature so that if he were to press the green button, the motor would turn on at a slow speed. However, if he chooses to press it two more times, it goes from slow to medium to fast and then back to slow, and so on. The red does the same thing but in the opposite direction. If green is going and he presses red, or vice versa, the motor will stop. Pretty cool! 

Watch the video to couple with the explanation, it’s all there!
