On December 12th, we hosted our first 24-hour [Mini Holiday Hackathon](https://www.codedex.io/community/monthly-challenge/december-2023)!  What better way to wrap up the year than get together for some fun and friendly competition? 🚀

176 hackers from 25+ countries joined us in Discord and worked collabortively to move a project forward and over the finish line! Altogether, it was a huge blast. 

We had two hackathon tracks: "In the Holiday Spirit" and "New Year, New Me".

👉 [Here are all 37 submissions from the teams.](https://www.codedex.io/community/monthly-challenge/december-2023) 👈
