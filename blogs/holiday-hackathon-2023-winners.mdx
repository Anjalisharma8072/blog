Last week, we hosted our first 24-hour [Mini Holiday Hackathon](https://www.codedex.io/community/monthly-challenge/december-2023)! What better way to wrap up the year than get together for some fun and friendly competition? üöÄ

**176 hackers** from **25 countries** joined us in Discord and worked collaboratively to move a team project forward and over the finish line! Altogether, it was a huge blast. 

We had two hackathon tracks: 1) "In the Holiday Spirit" and 2) "New Year, New Me".

üîó: [Here are all 37 team submissions.](https://www.codedex.io/community/monthly-challenge/december-2023)

And now, it's time to announce the results... ü•Å...
