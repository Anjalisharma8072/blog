On December 12th, we hosted our first-ever 24-hour Mini Holiday Hackathon!  What better way to wrap up the year than get together for some fun and friendly competition? 🚀

For those who are new to hackathons – this is a great one for you! Hackathons, especially mini ones, are a great way to dive head first into a project and learn a lot in a short period of time. Hackathons are also great to work collaboratively with other learners to move a project forward and over the finish line – communication is key!
