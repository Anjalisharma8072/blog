We’ve been listening closely to your feedback, and we’re absolutely thrilled to unveil that Codédex now offers certificates for completing the Python, HTML, and CSS courses! :newspaper:

#### Why a Certificate of Completion?

In the fast-paced world of tech, your skills and accomplishments deserve to be acknowledged. A certificate of completion is not just a piece of paper; it's a symbol of your commitment, perseverance, and growth. 

Whether you're a code newbie taking your first steps or an experienced developer looking to upskill, this certificate will be a testament to your journey and a powerful addition to your personal portfolio and LinkedIn profile.

#### What Makes Our Certificate Special?

**1. Tailored to Your Achievements**

This certificate isn't a one-size-fits-all template. It's personalized to showcase the specific course or courses you've completed. Whether you've delved into The Legend of Python, The Origins I: HTML, or The Origins II: CSS, your certificate will reflect your expertise in that language.

**2. Digital and Shareable**

Your certificate lives in the digital realm, just like your coding achievements. Easily share it on your social media profiles, LinkedIn, and personal websites to let the world know about your accomplishments. It's a badge of honor that can open doors to networking, collaboration, and career opportunities. Each certificate will also have its own unique URL, QR code, and Credible ID, so that it can be validated even 20 years later!

**3. Backed by Industry Experts**

Our certificates are backed by the expertise of our industry-leading instructors. These professionals have not only crafted the courses you've completed but have also validated your mastery of the skills covered. Their stamp of approval makes your certificate all the more valuable.

#### How Do I Get My Certificate?

To earn your certificate, you must successfully complete the entire course along with both the checkpoint and final project. As part of completing both the checkpoint and final projects, you must also get them reviewed by our team. Reviews not only help you improve by getting your work in front of others but we’re able to verify your course completion.

Here are the steps listed out:

1. Complete Chapters 1-4 in The Legend of Python.
2. Choose one Checkpoint Project to complete. You have the choice of Area Calculator, Rock Paper Scissors, or Terminal Adventure.
  - Once you’ve chosen and completed your checkpoint project, share it our Discord community channel, #checkpoint. Our team will review your submission within 2-3 business days.*
3. Continue on to complete Chapters 5-8.
4. Dive into the Final Project:
  - Similar to the checkpoint project, you’ll post your final project in the Discord community for a team review**.
5. Lastly, once you believe you’ve completed everything, please fill out this form to request your certificate of completion. 

*Checkpoint Project reviews consist of “Glows” and “Grows” – there’s no grading system. We assume that you’ve done your best, employed your learnings, and you're ready for feedback on where you did well (keep going!) and where there’s room for improvement.
