The summer is in full swing, which means it's vacation season and time to get in the sun! 🧳

- A defined height and width for the postcard.
- At least one `<img>` image element.
- At least one heading element (`<h1>` through `<h6>`).
- At least one `<p>` paragraph element.

## Inspiration ✨

Some ways to make the postcard unique include:

- Captivating and visually appealing design.
- Suitable typography and color scheme.
- A personalized message area.
