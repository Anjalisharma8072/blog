The CodÃ©dex team is headed on tour â€“ Campus Tour!!! ðŸšŒðŸ’¨

Throughout September and October, weâ€™ll be visiting hackathons (hey HackMIT & DivHacks!), Computer Science clubs at universities (hiii NYU & CCNY!) and ending the tour with our very own NYC event for CS and tech-adjacent majors. 

This is going to be fun!

#### What the heck is a Campus Tour?

CodÃ©dexâ€™s Campus Tour, as weâ€™re calling it, is a month-long adventure where our NYC-based team will be supporting and attending hackathons, supplying pizza parties and workshops for select university CS clubs as well as hosting our very own, branded event to wrap up the Back to School 2024 tour. We are so so excited and hope you are, too! 

**Hereâ€™s our lineup:**

- Sat 9/14: HackMIT @ **MIT** (Cambridge, MA)
- Tue 9/24: Pizza Party @ **NYU** (Brooklyn, NY) - [LinkedIn Event](https://www.linkcomingsoon.com)
- Thu 9/26: Pizza Party @ **CCNY** (New York, NY) - [Lu.ma](https://lu.ma/6t1fc9la)
- Sat 10/5:  DivHacks @ **Columbia** (New York, NY)
- Thu 10/10: Back to School Bash @ **Wix Playground** (New York, NY) - [Lu.ma](https://lu.ma/tvwccbhp)

Add schedule here.

#### Why are we touring?

Getting to know and be part of users and students journeys early and often is important to us! CodÃ©dex was created from one CS student who took 6 years to graduate a CS degree and loathed the fundamental classes that were taught in an outdated way.
