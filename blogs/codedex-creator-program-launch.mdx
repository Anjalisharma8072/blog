The secret’s out… we JUST launched our Codédex Creator Program!! ٩(＾ ◡ ＾)۶

This has been in the works (or should we say… something we’ve been cooking up 👩🏻‍🍳) for the past few months and we’re so happy to share this exciting news with you all. 🥳

#### What is the Codédex Creator Program?

TL;DR: it’s our first ambassador program. 👀

The long story? It’s our first-ever 2-month ambassador program of Codédex learners who truly love all things tech, coding, and the journey that comes with it. They’ll be creating content as a [#CodedexCreator](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/codedexcreator/) to represent not just Codédex the brand, but the beauty of starting your coding adventure.

#### What is the goal?

If you’re a learner, you *might* know how much we value community here at Codédex (on-platform community, Discord community, raising your own virtual pet friend through #30NitesOfCode… well, the list goes on and on) and because of that, our ultimate goal for this program is to continue building community!

We’ve united Codédex learners who are amazing content creators (amazing!!!) and most importantly, storytellers of how coding has changed and influenced their life. They’ve inspired us and we hope their stories inspire you too. 🌟

#### So… what’s next?

We’re truly so thrilled to have our [#CodedexCreator](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/codedexcreator/) peeps share their stories with you all. They’ll slowly start to make their appearance on our socials soon! 📲
