CodÃ©dex, a brand new learn to code platform for Gen Z, is thrilled to announce that weâ€™ve raised $750k in a pre-seed round led by [NP-Hard Ventures](https://nphard.vc), [Worklife Ventures](https://www.worklife.vc), [NY Ventures](https://esd.ny.gov/venture-capital), [Hustle Fund](https://www.hustlefund.vc), [Transcend Network](https://www.transcend-network.com), [Goodwater Capital](https://www.goodwatercap.com) & angels.

Weâ€™re a small-but-mighty team based in Brooklyn, NY and weâ€™re building a one-stop shop for the next generation of builders and dreamers. 

Since launching on Product Hunt a year ago, we now have:

- ðŸ’– 5 incredible team members who're supporting...
- ðŸ‘¯ 100k registered users from...
- ðŸŒŽ 192 countries around the world

... and weâ€™re just getting started.

In the months to come, weâ€™ll be supporting more teachers in K-12 schools, expanding our content catalog, and doubling down on our on-platform community.

Thanks for joining us on this ride, and special thanks to our whole community for believing in our mission to make learning to code fun and collaborative!

Back to building, see you in the [community](https://www.codedex.io/community)!
