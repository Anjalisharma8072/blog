We‚Äôre back and better with another... #30NitesOfCode! A brand new way to develop a coding habit. üëæ 

#### What is #30NitesOfCode?

#30NitesOfCode is a habit-building challenge where you commit to 30 days of learning 'n building. The best part? You get to care for a virtual pet who'll be your companion throughout your journey! ^.^ As you code every month, your pet grows and even evolves!

It's inspired by #100DaysOfCode and Tamagotchi. :)

You can do this challenge via Twitter or in our on-platform community (OPC).

Why you‚Äôll love it:

- ‚úÖ Raise a virtual pet along your coding journey
- ‚úÖ Accountability from other community members and Cod√©dex team via Twitter, OPC, and Discord
- ‚úÖ Learn and build new skills along the way

- 2466 tweets on Twitter (88%)
