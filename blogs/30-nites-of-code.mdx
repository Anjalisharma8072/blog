We‚Äôre back and better with another... #30NitesOfCode! A brand new way to develop a coding habit. üëæ 

##### What is #30NitesOfCode?

#30NitesOfCode is a habit-building challenge where you commit to 30 days of learning 'n building. The best part? You get to care for a virtual pet who'll be your companion throughout your journey! ^.^ As you code every month, your pet grows and even evolves!

It's inspired by #100DaysOfCode and Tamagotchi. :)

You can do this challenge via Twitter or in our on-platform community (OPC).
