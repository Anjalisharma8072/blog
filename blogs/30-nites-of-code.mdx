##### What is #30NitesOfCode?

At Cod√©dex, I am a part of the Curriculum team! I have written a couple of project tutorials, such as [Build a Soundboard with p5.js](https://www.codedex.io/projects/build-an-interactive-soundboard-with-p5js) and Deploy a Web Page with Vercel (coming soon!). I also help with reviewing course exercises and bonus articles that everyone sees on Cod√©dex, plus some fun side projects that I get to collaborate with the Community and Engineering teams.

##### Janauary 

We had a Monthly Challenge and it was a huge success. 


What's different about this one?

- You can now start on any day of the month!
- You can
- The Hall of Fame goes beyond 30 days now! So it will be more like a leaderboard.

##### What are the best aspects of working as a Curriculum Intern?

Some of the best aspects of working as a Curriculum Intern here at Cod√©dex is getting to work with all the really great people who started it! Getting to understand and review curriculum from past educators is really interesting to me, and I couldn‚Äôt have imagined getting to work with both the gaming and education sides of tech.

Also, I love talking to everyone in our Discord community, it‚Äôs been a fun time! üòå
