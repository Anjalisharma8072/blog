We’re back and better with another... #30NitesOfCode! 👾 

##### What is #30NitesOfCode?

#30NitesOfCode is a habit-building challenge for those who want to commit to 30 consecutive days of learning and building. You start by choosing an virtual pet and it will be your companion for the journey. As you code every month, your pet grows and even evolves!

It's inspired by #100DaysOfCode and Tamagotchi. :)

##### Janauary 

We had a January Monthly Challenge around the #30NitesOfCode pilot from 1/1/2024 to 1/30/2024 and it was a smash hit; people loved it! Over 517 registered and with:
- 2466 tweets on Twitter (88%)
- 324 posts in the OPC (12%)

Here are some of the pics!

We learned so much from it and took it down for a whole month to update it.

#### What's different about this one?

- It's now an evergreen feature! You can now start on any day of the month.
- You can
- The Hall of Fame goes beyond 30 days now! So it will be more like a leaderboard.

##### What are the best aspects of working as a Curriculum Intern?

Some of the best aspects of working as a Curriculum Intern here at Codédex is getting to work with all the really great people who started it! Getting to understand and review curriculum from past educators is really interesting to me, and I couldn’t have imagined getting to work with both the gaming and education sides of tech.

Also, I love talking to everyone in our Discord community, it’s been a fun time! 😌
