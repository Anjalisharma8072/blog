We are introducing a brand new leveling and ranking system on CodÃ©dex to represent your coding progress and proficiency level. ðŸ‘¾

Before ideating our own, we dug into popular EdTech platforms like Duolingo and some of our favorite games, such as Dota 2, League of Legends, and Overwatch. 

Here's what we came up with!

#### CodÃ©dex Levels

There are now 25 player levels on CodÃ©dex, from level 1 to level 25. 

Everyone starts at level 1. To level up, you must complete course exercises or code challenges to gain experience points (XP).

Your current level can be found in the stats section of your user profile. For example: **www.codedex.io/@sonny**.

#### CodÃ©dex Ranks

Levels get you ranks. Each rank has a name and badge icon associated with it that represents your programming proficiency.

The five ranks in CodÃ©dex include:

- <img src="https://i.imgur.com/lYWAZBL.png"> Bronze (Level 1-5)
- <img src="https://i.imgur.com/lYWAZBL.png"> Silver (Level 6-10)
- <img src="https://i.imgur.com/lYWAZBL.png"> Gold (Level 11-15)
- <img src="https://i.imgur.com/lYWAZBL.png"> Diamond (Level 16-20)
- <img src="https://i.imgur.com/lYWAZBL.png"> Platinum (Level 21-25)

Most CodÃ©dex learners will find themselves in the introductory ranks (e.g., Bronze and Silver) for quite a while, which is a testament to how difficult it can be to climb rankings.

#### How do I climb the ranking system?
