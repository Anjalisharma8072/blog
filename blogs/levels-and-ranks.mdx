Levels and ranks represent your coding progress and proficiency level. To earn your rank, you must complete course exercises or code challenges to gain XP, which will assign you a level thus rank.

There are five ranks and 25 levels that currently exist on Codédex. Experience Points (XP) gets you levels and levels get you ranks. With each rank, there’s a name and badge icon associated with it that represents your programming proficiency.

These are the five ranks:

- Bronze (Level 1-5)
- Silver (Level 6-10)
- Gold (Level 11-15)
- Diamond (Level 16-20)
- Platinum (Level 21-25)

#### How do I find my level and rank?

To find your level and rank, visit your user profile. On your profile page, next to your picture, you’ll see your rank in the badge form. Below that, in your stats section, you’ll see which level you’re at.
