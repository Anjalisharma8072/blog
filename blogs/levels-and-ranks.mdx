We are thrilled to unveil a big update to CodÃ©dex today! After listening to your feedback and working tirelessly behind the scenes, we are proud to present our brand new Levels and Ranking system. This adds a whole new dimension to your learning experience. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned coder, get ready to embark on an unforgettable coding adventure like never before! ðŸ‘¾

### Levels

Say goodbye to monotonous progress tracking! There are now 25 player levels on CodÃ©dex, from level 1 to level 25. 

Everyone starts at level 1. To level up, you must gain experience points (XP) by completing course exercises, code challenges, and on-platform activities (coming soon). The more you learn and practice, the higher your level will soar!

Alongside leveling up, you'll also unlock a series of features and special rewards. These could range from exclusive access to the community, in-game items, and more. ðŸ˜±

### Ranks

Your level determines your rank. Each rank has a name and badge icon associated with it that represents your overall programming proficiency and rizzes up your user profile.

The five ranks in CodÃ©dex are:

- <span style={{display: "flex", position: "relative", top: "6px"}}><img src="https://www.codedex.io/images/rank_badges/level_1.png" height="25" alt="Bronze Badge" style={{marginRight: "5px"}}/> Bronze (Level 1-5)</span>
- <span style={{display: "flex", position: "relative", top: "6px"}}><img src="https://www.codedex.io/images/rank_badges/level_2.png" height="25" alt="Silver Badge" style={{marginRight: "5px"}}/> Silver (Level 6-10)</span>
- <span style={{display: "flex", position: "relative", top: "6px"}}><img src="https://www.codedex.io/images/rank_badges/level_3.png" height="25" alt="Gold Badge" style={{marginRight: "5px"}}/> Gold (Level 11-15)</span>
- <span style={{display: "flex", position: "relative", top: "6px"}}><img src="https://www.codedex.io/images/rank_badges/level_4.png" height="25" alt="Diamond Badge" style={{marginRight: "5px"}}/> Diamond (Level 16-20)</span>
- <span style={{display: "flex", position: "relative", top: "6px"}}><img src="https://www.codedex.io/images/rank_badges/level_5.png" height="25" alt="Platinum Badge" style={{marginRight: "5px"}}/> Platinum (Level 21-25)</span>

Most CodÃ©dex learners will find themselves in the introductory ranks (e.g., Bronze and Silver) for quite a while, which is a testament to how difficult it can be to climb rankings.

#### How do I climb the ranking system?

<div className="nes-table-responsive work-sans">
  <table className="nes-table is-bordered is-centered">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Level</th>
        <th>Rank</th>
        <th>XP to Unlock</th>
        <th>Rewards</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Lvl 1</td>
        <td>Bronze</td>
        <td>N/A</td>
        <td>N/A</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Lvl 2</td>
        <td>Bronze</td>
        <td>100 XP</td>
        <td>Discord</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Lvl 3</td>
        <td>Bronze</td>
        <td>500 XP</td>
        <td>TBD</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Lvl 4</td>
        <td>Bronze</td>
        <td>1000 XP</td>
        <td>TBD</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Lvl 5</td>
        <td>Bronze</td>
        <td>1500 XP</td>
        <td>TBD</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Lvl 6</td>
        <td>Silver</td>
        <td>2000 XP</td>
        <td>TBD</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

#### Where do I find my current level and rank?

Your current level can be found in the stats section of your user profile. For example: [www.codedex.io/@sonny](https://www.codedex.io/@sonny).

On your profile page, next to your picture, youâ€™ll see your rank in the badge form. Below that, in your stats section, youâ€™ll see which level youâ€™re at.

#### How did you come up with this system?

Before ideating our own, we dug into popular EdTech platforms like Duolingo and some of our favorite games, such as Dota 2, League of Legends, and Overwatch.

Everyone thinks about leveling differently, and so do we. After countless hours of researching and brainstorming, this system that we arrived on makes the most sense for our learner base and for the space.
