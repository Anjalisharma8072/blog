We are introducing a brand new leveling and ranking system to represent your coding progress and proficiency level. ðŸ‘¾

Before ideating our own, we took a good look at popular EdTech platforms like Duolingo and some of our favorite video games, such as Dota 2, League of Legends, and Overwatch. 

Here's what we came up with!

#### CodÃ©dex Levels

There are now 25 player levels on CodÃ©dex, from level 1 to level 25. Everyone starts at level 1.

To level up, you must complete course exercises or code challenges to gain Experience Points (XP). which will assign you a level thus rank.

You can find your current level on your user profile page at **www.codedex.io/@username**.

#### CodÃ©dex Ranks

Levels get you ranks. With each rank, thereâ€™s a name and badge icon associated with it that represents your programming proficiency.

The five ranks in CodÃ©dex include:

- Bronze (Level 1-5)
- Silver (Level 6-10)
- Gold (Level 11-15)
- Diamond (Level 16-20)
- Platinum (Level 21-25)

The majority of the current CodÃ©dex learners find themselves in the introductory ranks of Bronze and Silver for a quite a while, which is a testament to how difficult it can be to climb ranks.

| Levels      |  Rank       | XP to Unlock | Rewards |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------- |
| Lvl 1       | Bronze      | N/A          | N/A     |
| Lvl 2       | Bronze      | 100 XP       | Discord |
| Lvl 3       | Bronze      | 500 XP       | TBD     |
| Lvl 4       | Bronze      | 1000 XP      | TBD     |
| Lvl 5       | Bronze      | 1500 XP      | TBD     |
| Lvl 6       | Silver      | 2000 XP      | TBD     |

#### How do I find my level and rank?

To find your level and rank, visit your user profile. On your profile page, next to your picture, youâ€™ll see your rank in the badge form. Below that, in your stats section, youâ€™ll see which level youâ€™re at.
