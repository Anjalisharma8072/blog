Hello CS students, **Harvard WECode 2024** is happening this weekend (February 17-18) and Cod√©dex is sponsoring the event! 

#### What the heck is WECode?

[WECode](https://www.harvardwecode.com) is the world‚Äôs largest student-run women in tech conference. It‚Äôs a two-day event packed full of panel talks, fireside chats, and workshops. Over a thousand students from 300+ universities are attending ‚Äì this is a perfect opportunity to meet fellow techies from other schools.

This year, Cod√©dex team members [Katherin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katherin-s-29970a124), [Naomi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/naomixlee), and [Sonny](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sonnynomnom) are flying to Cambridge, MA to attend! Yayyy! ‚úàÔ∏è

This will be the third stop of our February Campus Tour:

- ‚õ≥Ô∏è TartanHacks (Pittsburgh, PA) 2/3* 
- ‚õ≥Ô∏è SBUHacks (Stony Brook, NY) 2/10 
- ‚õ≥Ô∏è WECode (Cambridge, MA) 2/17-18 ‚ú®

We‚Äôll be filming on-the-street style interview videos, passing out limited edition merch on Sunday (February 18), and chatting with everyone! 

There will also be a **Cod√©dex booth at the Career Fair (Sunday @ 3-5 pm)**, where you'll get to meet the team, grab free stickers, learn all about Cod√©dex, and for a chance to be in our new Cod√©dex Creator Program! üëÄ
