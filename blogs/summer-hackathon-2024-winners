We just wrapped up our first ever 24-hour [Summer Hackathon](https://www.codedex.io/hackathon)! 

Summer is the perfect time to. What better way to in the heat wave than get together for some fun and friendly competition? 🚀

**2,014 hackers** from **57+ countries** showed up and **259 teams** made it across the [finish line](https://www.codedex.io/community/hackathon)! Altogether, it was a HUGE blast. 

We had two hackathon tracks: 1) "Board Game Cafe", 2) "Stoop Sale Invitation", and 3) "Paris Olympics Predicitions". 

And $10,000 worth of prizes.

Now, it's time to announce the results... 🥁...
