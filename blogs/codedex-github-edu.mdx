BIG news! Codédex is now part of the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://www.codedex.io/github-students)!!! 🥳

#### Spill the tea! What does this mean for me?

If you are a verified student through GitHub Education, you can receive 6 months of [Codedex Club](https://www.codedex.io/pricing) — a premium membership — for FREE!

With a Codédex Club membership, you’ll gain access to:

- 🌈 Full content catalog: The Legend of Python, Origins Trilogy, and more
- ➕ Bonus Articles & Cheat Sheets as supplemental material
- 🎴 Challenge Packs (think LeetCode!)
- 🚀 Checkpoint and Final Projects 
- 📜 Course Certificates
- 🗓️ Exclusive invites to community events

#### Why we partnered with GitHub Education

TL;DR is that it made sense! This is a dream collab!

The longer story: Much like GitHub’s mission statement to “help every developer — regardless of experience — learn, code and ship software effectively,” Codédex is on a mission to level up the next wave of builders! We’re firm believers that every aspiring developer needs a strong foundation that’s accessible both in price and approach.

We’re thrilled to be part of the GitHub Student Developer Pack and offer a 6-month Codédex Club membership to help YOU level up! 

And if we’re really being honest on why we partnered with GitHub, it’s a full circle moment for our small-but-mighty team — we love GitHub and use it every day! 💖

#### Why Codédex's great for students

Your CS professor will likely bore you, but we won’t. Our team promises to deliver fun & accessible content on the most widely used programming languages, frameworks, and tools.

We’ve designed our curriculum so that you’ll gain a strong foundation in programming fundamentals and that will help you put into practice what you last learned. At the end of each course, you’ll bring it full circle with a mini project. Along the way, you’ll unlock bonus articles and cheat sheets that’ll supplement what you learn in lessons.

With a pinch of gamification and pop culture references, we will get you through the initial learning curve with ease. ✨

And did I mention Community?! We have a robust community on our platform & in Discord. Weekly, we host interactive events such as: Office Hours with the Codédex Team, Project Show & Tell, tech workshops ([Basic Debugging](https://discord.gg/VAtARArQ?event=1207038533907517440) and [Getting Started with GitHub](https://discord.gg/VAtARArQ?event=1207055343331442688) are coming up!), [Monthly Challenges](https://www.codedex.io/community/monthly-challenge/february-2024), and more. Join 125,000+ learners and start your coding adventure today!
