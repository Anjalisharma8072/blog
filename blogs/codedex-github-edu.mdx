## Exciting news — Codédex is now part of the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://www.codedex.io/github-students)!!

#### Spill the tea… what does this mean for me?

If you are a verified student through GitHub Education, you can receive 6 months of [Codedex Club](https://www.codedex.io/pricing) - a premium membership - for FREE!

With a Codédex Club membership, you’ll gain access to:

- Full content catalog (Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git & GitHub, and Command Line courses and more)
- Bonus Articles & Cheat Sheets as supplemental material to our courses
- Code Challenges (think LeetCode!)
- Checkpoint and Final Projects 
- Course Certificates
- Exclusive invites to community events

#### Why we partnered with GitHub Education

The short story… it made sense! 

The longer story: Much like GitHub’s mission to “help every developer –– regardless of experience –– learn, code and ship software effectively,” Codédex is on a mission to level up the next wave of builders in college or who are career-switching! We’re firm believers that every aspiring developer needs a strong foundation that’s accessible both in price and approach.

We’re thrilled to be part of the GitHub Student Developer Pack and offer a 6-month Codédex Club membership to help YOU level up! 

And if we’re really being honest on why we partnered with GitHub, it’s a full circle moment for our small-but-mighty team –– we love GitHub and use it every day!!

#### Why it's great for students

Your CS professor will likely bore you, but we won’t. Our team promises to deliver fun & accessible content on the most widely used programming languages, frameworks, and tools. 

We’ve designed our curriculum so that you’ll gain a strong foundation in programming fundamentals and that will help you put into practice what you last learned. At the end of each course, you’ll bring it full circle with a mini project. Along the way, you’ll unlock bonus articles and cheat sheets that’ll supplement what you learn in lessons.

And did I mention our Community?! We have a robust community on our platform & on Discord. Weekly, we host interactive events such as: Office Hours w the Codédex Team, Project Show & Tell, tech workshops (e.g., Getting Started with GitHub, Intro to Debugging, etc.), Monthly Challenges, and more.

#### Getting started w GitHub Student Developer Pack

If you are already verified via GitHub Education, simply go here: https://education.github.com/pack to find the Codédex tile (scroll all the way down).


If you are NOT already verified via GitHub Education, follow the below steps:

- Go to https://www.codedex.io/github-students
- Click on “Sign up with GitHub”. 
- If you do not have your GitHub student account connected to your Codédex account, you will need to go to https://education.github.com/pack > “Sign up for Student Developer Pack”.
- Complete the application using your .edu email and/or upload necessary proof of academic status.
- Once you’ve uploaded your academic status docs on the following page and submit them, it will take anywhere from 1 hour to 9 days for GitHub to verify you as a student. Stay tuned!!

Once you have a Club membership, you should see a rainbow CLUB logo appear in your User Dashboard as well as in your Account > Settings.

Welcome to the Club! Hope you enjoy this partnership and make sure to tell all your CS friends!

Happy coding! ✌️
